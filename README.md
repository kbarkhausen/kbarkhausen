As an Enterprise Software Architect and AI Integration Specialist, I bring 25+ years of experience in designing and delivering scalable .NET solutions for enterprise clients. My core expertise lies in architecting complex, mission-critical systems using technologies like .NET, Azure, SQL Server, and cloud-native patterns—while also mentoring teams to follow best practices, adopt modern engineering principles, and deliver reliable software at scale.

In recent years, I’ve evolved my focus to include the integration of artificial intelligence into both software systems and development workflows. I use AI not only to enhance applications with intelligent features—like recommendation engines, automation agents, and semantic search—but also to improve codebases through smart refactoring, automated testing, and architectural validation. My goal is to help organizations accelerate delivery, reduce technical debt, and increase software reliability by embedding AI into their development lifecycles.

I have a proven track record of helping organizations like Cartier, Aflac, and McAfee solve complex problems, modernize legacy systems, and build future-ready platforms. Whether it's reengineering outdated architectures, implementing secure multi-tenant SaaS platforms, or leveraging AI to improve product and team performance, I bring deep technical insight and a strategic mindset to every engagement.

I’m passionate about using artificial intelligence not as a bolt-on feature, but as a force multiplier across the business—helping companies unlock new capabilities, deliver smarter user experiences, and achieve their strategic goals faster.
